If you want to land a great JavaScript job or catch up on important tech for 2020 and important technologies in the new decade, this post is for you. The point of this post is not to tell you which tech stacks and frameworks are the “best” or most loved or most popular — but to shed some light on which ones give you the best odds of landing a great job in 2020 and beyond.

None of these metrics are perfect, but for our purposes, the npm download counts and job postings get the most weight, and when we look at the metrics in aggregate, they paint a clear and consistent picture of the JavaScript technology landscape and trends. Is it a good idea to select a framework to learn based on these metrics? That depends on your goal.

```javascript
var a = 4;
function myFunction() {
  return a * a;
}
```
